# Concept

This idea consist in create an app where you can create a curriculum based in a determined **template.** Inside the app, you can create, edit and delete fields inside the CV, both a new section and an attribute. Once the curriculum is ended, you can download the CV as a PDF, and also you can export the data to import it in the future (in JSON format). All the data, anyway, will persist in the local storage
